            <h1>Website Design</h1>
            I find website design hard. I am thinking about a new flat design for this website, what do you think?
            Now that I have remade my entire website using bootstrap I think that I kind of want a nece, clean flat design, it just works better with white, black and some icons.
            But the problem is that redesigning an entire website takes so much time, that I generaly do not have.
            I like google's material design, but that will be so much work for me to implement in my website, but then, it looks good doesen't it.
            If I do this I will stick to some things,  keep them the same throughout the website.
            A clean look, no adverts, no libraries.  This will make it hard though.  That will mean no jQuery, no bootstrap, just pure, plain JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5 and spelling mistakes.
            I think that I will do that, just it will take a long time.
            <br>
            The problem with me and writing code is that it looks something like this:
            <img src="http://i.cubeupload.com/GSJx5u.png"><br>
            My code starts out all fine and working for what it does, then I get stuck, look at it for a bit and then it turns into, well, the picture above.
            So I am not exactly the best at writing several thousand line js and css files.  Sometimes I have had kind of half decent code end up like:
            <img src="http://i.cubeupload.com/GAmRZ2.png"><br>
            Yes, that is a blank image. My code can become like useless and just output strings like "functionfunction(functionfunctionfunction)functionfunction{functionfunction}function" from perfectly normal code like "function hello() {return true}".  What is going on here?
            But I think that I will re make my website.  I surpost hat I can do it given enough time.  So yeah.  This is the first time I have written something like this.  So please tell me what you think.
